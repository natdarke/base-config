# Dev
* Env files for dev are correct

# Prod 
* Prod env are currently same as dev which needs to change
* In prod, env vars will change per customer/domain. At first his will probably involve passing the data in for each customer/domain. Eventually this would probably change to manually created data in a database, then finally, auto-generated data in a database
